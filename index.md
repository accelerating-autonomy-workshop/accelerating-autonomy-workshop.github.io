The Accelerating the Use of Autonomy on Robotic Space Missions Workshop will focus on the following questions:

- What are the impediments to making more use of autonomy on robotic space missions?

- Which of those impediments apply to which kinds of space missions?

- In order to overcome those impediments,

	- What has been done in the past that has proven successful?

	- What approaches show promise, and what needs to be done to prove their worth?

	- What further ideas can be proposed?

Those interested in participating are encouraged to suggest answers to any of the above questions and email them in advance to Martin.S.Feather@jpl.nasa.gov.

Answers are also welcomed from those not planning to participate in the workshop.
